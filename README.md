# Word Rhythms!

Word rhythms is a drag and drop game that is designed to help young kids associate common words with their rhythmic equivalents. Players can drop icons into 
boxes and once all four boxes are filled, they can toggle between playing voice sounds and drum sounds. There are currently two themes each with different icons that can be toggled with a dropdown menu.
